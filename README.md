This is a Custom Vendor device configuration, which is created from the default Car Emulator configuration "**sdk_car_x86_64-userdebug**"

In the vendor folder create your vendor name, then check out this repo. Run env config and lunch. Device will be listed in the build configuration.
"MyCarApp" is a test app created by me, you might want to remove it from device mk file.
